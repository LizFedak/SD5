1: Create a new express project.  
  
2: Your objective is to create an employee management portal. You will create (i.e. hire) employees, and manage details about them.  
  
Schema should conform to:
* Employees
  * firstname
  * lastname
  * email
  * phone number
  * address
    * street
    * city
    * state
    * zip
  * hire date
  * punchcards
    * time in
    * time out
    * date
  * salary
  * manager (boolean)
  * emergency contact
    * name
    * phone number
  
Be sure to write validations. Don't worry about a view, just make sure that you can access the data correctly with Postman.
