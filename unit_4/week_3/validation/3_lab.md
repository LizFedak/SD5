# Validation Lab
1: Apply validation to the registration form.  
  
* all fields are required
* password must be longer than 6 characters
* user name must be longer than 4 characters and not longer than 12
  
2: Apply styles to the form fields:  
  
* invalid fields should be a light pink color
* valid fields should be green
  
3: Create a div and display error messages to the user about why the form is not passing validation.
