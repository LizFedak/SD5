# What is a framework?

* Frameworks assist us by simplifying common problems developers approaching similar tasks have encountered previously.
  
* Instead of writing our own (often lengthy) solution to one of these problems, the framework provides us with some interface that makes our lives easier. This often comes in the form of opinionated structure, methods, or objects.
  
* We have used frameworks previously in both JavaScript (Express) and Java (Spring). They are extremely common accross all languages.
  
* The question to be asked when deciding on a framework to use is, "what problem am I trying to solve?". For Express, the problem is "How can I make Node HTTP routing easier less verbose and repetitive?".
  
* ***"Why use Angular?"***
  * The AngularJS framework makes JavaScript DOM manipulation simple, it excels at CRUD, makes creating re-useable HTML simple, and fully implements MVC. All of this makes Angular an excellent choice for most web applications.
