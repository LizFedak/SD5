# Review Lab
  
* This lab's objective is to get you to bootstrap the simplest of Angular apps, and get a feel for what that looks like when it works...and maybe what errors look like when it doesn't.
  
1: Create a directory name first_ng. Inside of this directory, create an index.html file.  
  
2: Download and copy angular.min.js into the first_ng directory.  
  
Get "Hello Angular" printed to the browser.  
  
3: Create three input fields:
  * fname
  * mname
  * lname
  
Use live-bindings to print out the name entered into these fields.  
  
4: Wrap each of your bindings in a span element. Use the `ngShow` directive to only show the span if the model is defined.  
  
5: The `ngClick` directive can take multiple arguments in an array. Create a "clear" button and use `ngClick` to set the 'fname', 'mname', and 'lname' model values to empty strings.
