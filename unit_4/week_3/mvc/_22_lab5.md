# Lab 5: Refactor Lab!
* This lab will continue to build upon the Todo application from the previous labs. We will be refactoring the previous work.
  
* you are going to create several files and directories, below is the resulting tree structure:

```bash
index.html
├── controllers
│   └── todosController.js
├── directives
│   ├── myFooter
│   │   ├── myFooter.js
│   │   └── myFooter.template.html
│   └── todoRow
│       ├── todoRow.js
│       └── todoRow.template.html
├── filters
│   └── completedFilter.js
├── ngApp.js
└── services
    └── todoService.js
```
  
1: You task is to create these files/directories, and move the appropriate code out of the script tags in the head of your index.html.  
  
2: The loan 'ngApp.js' file outside of a directory is where you should place your module constructor.
  
3: Import all of the *.js files into the head of your index.js. Remember to import AngularJS first, then the module, and only then all of your other script files.  
  
**When you are done refactoring, you will likely have difficulty running your code for one reason or another. That's fine for now, the next lab should solve that.**
