# Lab 7: Build an API
* This lab will continue to build upon the Todo application from the previous labs. We will be refactoring the previous work. 
  
* Now we will build a backend for our todo data so that it remains persisted after refresh.
  
1: In your 'todo_app', create an 'app_api' directory.  
  
Then add:  
  
```bash
├── controllers
│   └── todoCtrl.js
└── routes
    └── todoRoutes.js
```
  
2: in 'todoRoutes.js', add routes for:
  * GET `'/'`
  * PUT `'/:id'`
  * DELETE `'/:id'`
  * POST `'/'`
  
3: in 'todoCtrl.js', create methods:
  * `index` : return all todos
  * `update` : update a todo by id
  * `destroy` : delete a todo by id
  * `create` : create a todo
* **NOTE**: You may use either mysql, or mongo (no need for an ORM/ODM, this is small potatoes).
  
4: Use your controller methods in your routes.  
  
5: Require your routes in your 'app.js' to the `'/todos'` path  
  
6: Test your routes/database with Postman, you should get json back that looks identical to the hard coded objects in your AngularJS app.
