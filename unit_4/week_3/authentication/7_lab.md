# Authentication Lab
* Apply authentication to your application:
  
1: Create an 'authenticationService'  
  
2: Inject the authentication service into your 'loginController', on form submission, use the service to log a user in.  
  
3: Create a server side login controller, ensure that the user exists and his/her password matches. If so, generate an return a JWT to the client.  
  
Make sure that your Authentication Service stores the JWT into local storage.  
  
4: Create server side authentication that ensures users cannot access todo data if they are not logged in (but can access it if they are logged in).  
  
5: Implement log out.
