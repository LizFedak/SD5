# 0 - Testing with the Node REPL
* A REPL is a 'read-eval-print loop'  

* REPL's provide programmers with a language shell where code can be tested and interacted with outside of the context of a file structure.
  
* To use Node's REPL, simply enter the `node` command with no arguments into your terminal, this will provide you with an interactive shell to experiment with JavaScript. Example:  

```bash
$User: > node
> var greeting = 'hello';
undefined
> greeting
'hello'

```
  
* REPL's are useful for testing code outside of your application and without the additional baggage of having to create a test file to run.
  
* Be sure to experiment with the following core concepts in your REPL as we proceed.
