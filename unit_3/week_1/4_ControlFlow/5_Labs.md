### Labs

0: Create a file named 'control.js'  

1: Write a program that loops from 0 to 9, logging each number and its square (use a `for` loop).  

2: Rewrite the solution to #1, use a `while` loop.  

3: Modify you solution to #2 to also calculate the cube of each number. Only print the cube the value of the cube is even.  

4: Modify your solution to #3 to both calculate and print the cube of each number only if the original number is even.  

5: The Fibonacci series is a series fo numbers in which the first two numbers are 0 and 1. Each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. So, the next Fibonaci number is `(0+1)=1`. The next is `(1+1)=2`. Then `(1+2)=3`...etc etc.  
  
Write a program that uses a `for` loop to print the first 20 Fibonacci Numbers. Remember that the first two are pre-defined as 0 and 1. All subsequent numbers are calculated from there.  
  
6: Modify your solution to #5, so that the sequence is printed out next to the fibonacci value. Make sure that the sequence numbers 0 and 1 match up with the first two pre-defined values.  
  
7: Create an object modeling a person. Add properties for `fname`, `lname`, `age`, `email`, and `friends` (an Array). Add some values to each of the properties.  
  
Use the `for ... in` loop to iterate over the properties and log them to the console.
  
8: Using the object from #7, create a new `for...in` loop and log each of the `friends` names with a for loop (but don't print out any of the other property values)...hint: use typeof.
  
9: Using the object you created in #7, use a conditional to check the person's age. If they are over 16, they can drive. If they are over 18, they can vote, and if they are over 21, they can drink. Don't forget that 21 year olds can also vote and drive!
