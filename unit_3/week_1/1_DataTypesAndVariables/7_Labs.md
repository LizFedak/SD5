### Labs
0: Create a file named 'dog.js'  
  
1: Create variables to hold the following information about a dog:
  * name
  * weight
  * length of tail
  * whether or not it is friendly

2: Modify your previous code to assign values to each of the variables.  
  
3: Use `console.log()` to log the value of each of the variables to the console.  
  
4: Just before your `console.log()`s, re-assign the values of your variables to a different type for instance:  
  
```javascript
var name = 'dog'
name = 9
console.log(name);
```

5: Create an array literal with each of the twelve months stored as strings. Use `console.log()` to log the month you were born.  
  
6: Declare a variable 'name', but don't initialize it with a variable. Use `console.log()` to print out the variable, what is the result?
