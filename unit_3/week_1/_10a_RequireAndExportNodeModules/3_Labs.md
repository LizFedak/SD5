### Labs
1: In the previous set of labs you created an account module. At the bottom of that file export the module.
  
  
2: create a new file in the same director named `app.js` and require the file the module is in, assigning the require to a variable `acct`.
  

3: Create a new account with the variable, and use `console.log` to print out the current account balance. Run `app.js` in terminal with `node app.js`
