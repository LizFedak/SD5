### Labs
0: Create an HTML file named `traverse.html` and a JavaScript file named `travers.js`  
  
1: Write a well formed HTML document in `traverse.html` and add an `<h1>` that says 'hello world'.  
  
2: Import your `traverse.js` file into your `traverse.html` file using `<script src=''></script>`  
  
3: In your JS file, select the `<h1>` element, use `.textContent` to change 'hello world' to your name.  
  
4: Add an unordered list of 5 list items to the HTML (don't put any text between the `<li>`s)  
  
5: Create an array with five string values in it.  
  
6: Use a query selector to select the unordered list and store it in a variable.  
  
7: Use a `for` loop to iterate over the children of your list, use `textContent` to insert the values from your array into each of the list items.
