### Labs
0: Create a file named 'operators.js'  

1: Write a program that creates two variables to hold the temperature in Fahrenheit and Celsius. Initialize the Fahrenheit variable with 212 degrees. Determine the Celsius temperature by using the following formula: `Celsius = (Fahrenheit minus 32) times 5 divided by 9`  

2: Write a program that stores numeric values for one week (ie. 7 variables or an array with 7 indexes). Print the daily rainfall amounts and calculate and print the total rainfall for the week, as well as the average rainfall for the week.  

3: Write a program that has two number variables (`x` & `y`). Write the program to round off `x` to the next largest multiple of the other integer `y`. (i.e. `x = 256`, `y = 7` => `259`)
