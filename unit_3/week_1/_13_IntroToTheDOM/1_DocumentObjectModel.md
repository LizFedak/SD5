### Document Object Model
* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a 'Document Object Model' (DOM) of the page.
  
* The DOM is a programming interface for HTML. It exposes and grants read/write access to:
  * HTML elements (represented as objects)
  * the properties of the HTML elements
  * the methods to access HTML elements
  * the events for all HTML elements
  
* The DOM is accessible by JavaScript throught the top level global object `Window`. The `Window` object has several nested properties, which allow us to access browser functionality programmatically.
