### Labs
0: Create a new file named 'inherit.js'  
  
1: Create a class called `Vehicle` that contains properties for:
  * `maxSpeed`
  * `numWheels`
  
  
2: Create a subclass of `Vehicle` called `Bicycle` that contains a field for the number of gears (`numGears`) on the bike. ALL bikes should have 2 wheels.
  
  
3: Add a `display()` method to the `Vehicle` class.
  
  
Create a `Bicycle` object and a `Vehicle` object, `display()` both.
  

4: Create another `Vehicle` and another `Bicycle`. Add all of your instances to an array. Loop over the array, calling `display()` on each of the elements if they are an `instanceof` `Vehicle`.
  

5: Update your loop to only run the `display()` method if they are an instance of `Bicycle`
