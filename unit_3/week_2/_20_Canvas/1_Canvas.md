### `<canvas>`
* `<canvas></canvas>` provides a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more 'rendering contexts', which are used to create and manipulate the content shown.
  
* There are only two attributes which affect `<canvas>`, `height` and `width`:
  
```html
<canvas height="200" width="200">
</canvas>
```
