## Todo app

### Overview
Todo apps are synonymous with basic CRUD in programming. Successfully building a todo app demonstrates a solid fundamental understanding of a technologies implementation. This specific application will be using javascript, node, express, and mysql.

### Goals
* Get comfortable with connecting a db to your express projects
* Use a defined pattern to organize your files
* Implement full CRUD with node/express

### Requirements
* Use the required technologies mentioned above.
* Follow the Express pattern discussed in class for your file structure .
* Implement Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality in your application.
* Persist data to a mySQL database.

### Steps
**Track with Git**
Go through the familiar process of creating a repo on Github and pointing your local files to it. At some point something is going to break and its good to have prior versions accessible.

**Configuration**  
Make sure your project is properly configured by setting up a simple Hello World example.

**Start to write your business logic**  
Start working on your applications logic by setting up your views and routes. Begin by using static or hardcoded data.

**Create and connect to mySQL**  
Create a simple SQL database to store your todo objects. Test your connection in the `app.js` file before moving that logic to a model.
