### Overview
* HTTP cookies are a relatively reliable way to track user browsing behavior on a website. They can also be used to store data for non-account users as they navigate your site.
  
* An excellent example of this would be keeping track of a users shopping cart items prior to them logging into your site. As they navigate between pages their items are persisted in their cart cookie which may or may not be encrypted to protect their data from cookie scrapers.
  
* It is worth noting that this data could also be persisted in the user's session, which is in and of itself a cookie (albeit with some slightly different behavior). Typically sessions are cleared by browsers when the browser window is closed or the application is quit.
