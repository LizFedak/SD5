### 2. Download Heroku Toolbelt
* Go to [https://toolbelt.heroku.com/][toolbelt]
* Click the 'Heroku Toolbelt for <operating system>' button (where '<operating system>' is your operating system).
* Once downloaded, install the package
When complete, run `which heroku` in terminal, and you should see the location of the binary file for heroku (i.e. `/usr/local/heroku/bin/heroku`)
* Enter the command `heroku login` and heroku will install some core heroku-cli dependencies and then prompt your for your login credentials.  

(NOTE: the bin location will automatically be added to your PATH)
