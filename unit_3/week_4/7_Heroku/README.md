### Overview
At its core, the Heroku platform is a service that assists developers in quickly and easily deploying web applications to the AWS cloud. However, this is an over simplification.  
  
Heroku abstracts the deployment process for the sake of convenience to the developer. With a few quick commands you will be able to deploy applications to the web, and configure them to use web based databases...all for free (up to 5 applications...then you've gotta pay).  
  
Heroku's tag line is 'Get straight to building apps...not infrastructure', they provide much of the infrastructure configuration for you, in fact, they tie together a huge list of technologies behind the scenes:  
  
This is definitely a powerful tool, but as such, it is also highly opinionated and you will have to follow the Heroku conventions to get your app up and running.  
  
What follows is a guide of how to get up and running with the platform and create an application from scratch. There is also an [example application](herokuTest) included in this directory.
