### 1. Create an Account
* Go to [https://www.heroku.com][heroku]
* Click 'Sign up'
* Complete and submit the form (it doesn't really matter what language you select as your primary, so don't be too concerned with that field).
* Wait for Heroku to send you a confirmation email (0-20 minutes in my experience)
* When the email is received, click the link provided, and create a strong password, this will complete you account creation and sign you into your dashboard
