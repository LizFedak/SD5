### 8. Changing the Apps Name
* Heroku gives you free hosting, and while you won't be able to drop the '.herokuapp.com' part of the URI, you can rename your app to something more memorable.
* In terminal enter `heroku app:rename newnameofapp`, this will update the repository and the URI in one fell swoop.
  * NOTE: name must follow some formatting rules. If it doesn't like what you enter, it will give you tips.
* Alternatively, if you have a DNS hanging around, you can go to your dashboard and add a custom domain.
