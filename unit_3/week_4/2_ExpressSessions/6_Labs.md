### Labs
1: Using the same application you made for cookies, add the session dependencies
  
  
2: Create a route for login ('/login'), which places a user object into the session and the sends 'logged in' with the response
  
  
3: Create a route for logout ('/logout'), which sets the user session to `null`
  
  
4: Create a ('/user') route, which sends the user object with the response if there is one in the session, and 'No user', if there isn't a user logged in
