### Jets

#### Application Overview
You are going to create a fleet of jets!..in code...your application will be a menu to access information about your jets.

As you work through the user stories think about what classes you will need (it's probably more than you think) before your start writing code.

I'm adding more stretch goals this week as User Stories for you to get some more OO practice.

For those of you that are having trouble getting started, we have provided you with a potential UML diagram [here](UMLJets.png). Also attached is a [rubric](JetsRubric.pdf) that shows how your assignments will be graded.

#### User Story #1
There is a menu with 4 options:
* List fleet
* View fastest jet
* View jet with longest range
* Quit

#### User Story #2
List fleet prints out the speed, range, passenger capacity, and price of each jet

#### User Story #3
The view jet options both print out all of the information about their jets

#### User Story #4
Quit exits the program

#### User Story #5
A user can add custom jets to the fleet

#### Stretch Goals

#### User Story #6
Each jet has a pilot

#### User Story #7
Each pilot must have at least 3 years of experience to work at the airline and must have served in the AirForce.

#### User Story #8
Users can hire pilots

#### User Story #9
Whenever a jet's information is displayed, that jet's pilot and his/her information should also be displayed
