### Employee Menu

#### Application Overview
Remember when we made that Employee Menu last week? Well we are going to implement what we've learned this week and improve it's functionality.

Use your existing code (copy it into a new file in this directory), and lets refactor things to be Object Oriented.

#### User Story #1
When we list employees, we need more information. We need:
* first and last name
* salary
* email address
* employee number
* title

#### User Story #2
We need to be able to promote a specific employee, entering a new title and a new salary when we do so.

#### User Story #3
When we hire new employees we should be required to enter in all of their information.

#### User Story #4
We need to know who is getting paid the most, we need a menu option that returns a list of our employees sorted by salary (also display their salary)

#### User Story #5
We decided to pivot some our employees into dog walking. They need to be able to walk the dogs, feed the dogs and should each have a list of the dogs they take care of.

#### User Story #6
We need a menu option that tells our dog walking employees to feed or walk the dogs, and we want feedback telling us which dog was walked or fed.
