### Roman Numerals

#### Application Overview

You are going to make an application that converts Hindu-Arabic Numerals (i.e. 1,2,3) into Roman Numerals (i.e. I, II, III). You will build up the logic user story by user story to allow for larger and larger numbers to be converted. Don't try to jump ahead too fast, make sure that each step is working, and that the previous user stories are still working correctly after you've moved onto the next solution.

#### User Story #1

The user is asked to input a number less than 10.

#### User Story #2

The user is presented with the Roman Numeral which corresponds to the number they entered.

#### User Story #3

User is re-prompted to enter a number up to 100.

#### Stretch Goals
* User is re-prompted to enter a number up to 1,000.

* If you haven't already, refactor your code to be contained within methods. Only call one method in your main.

* Now that you understand the logic to go from numbers to numerals, can you do the reverse? Take Roman Numerals as input and convert them into Hindu-Arabic Numbers.
