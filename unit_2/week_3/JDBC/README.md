### JDBC

Tha Java Data Base Connectivity API allows a Java program to connect to and interact with a relational database.  Proficiency with JDBC is a crucial skill for a Java application developer.

In this module you'll learn how to write a Java program that connects to a database, executes a query, iterates through the result set rows, performs DML operations and transaction control.  You'll also learn how and why to use prepared statements and use result-set metadata to manage ad-hoc query results.
