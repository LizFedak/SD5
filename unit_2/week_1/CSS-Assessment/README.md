### CSS basics

#### Overview
Lets look back at our HTML assessment from this morning. We are going to practice targeting and applying styles to these elements. You should use and reference an external stylesheet, and use NO inline styles. We will give you a standardized HTML solution, to this morning's exercise, that you will use to complete this assignment. This is so we have a standardized template to assess your work. **If you use a separate document your work will not be accepted!** Only use CSS to alter the look of the page,do not alter the raw HTML in the document.

##### User Story #1
Your headers should be changed to your favorite color and set to a size of 2em. (Notice they are not all the same tag!)

##### User Story #2
Your table should have bold/colored table headers, as well as lines delineating the tables sections. Content should be centered in their respective blocks.

##### User Story #3
Your list should have square list bullets. You can style this additionally if you choose to.

##### User Story #4
When the user hovers over a hyperlink the background color of the hyperlink should change and it should not be underlined.

##### User Story #5
Use CSS to capitalize the first word in text blocks.

##### User Story #6
Set the background color of the quotation text (2nd paragraph) to a dark color and the font color to a contrasting light color.

##### User Story #7
Make each team's image the background image for the list.

##### User Story #8
This checkbox list should not be bulleted. Style the checkboxes in the form section of the document to be in 2 columns (a 2 x 2 grid).

#### Stretch goals
You can continue styling and or adding any HTML elements you want to this file. It is good practice to learn how to target the individual elements by tag, class, or id.
