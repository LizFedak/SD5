## Personal Resume Site Project

#### Overview
Over the course of this week we are going to build out a website where you can link to your projects, Github, maybe even a resume. This should contextualize the HTML and CSS skills you are learning while giving you some meaningful practice. We have broken up the project into steps describing features you can add to your site:

* [Step1](Step1)  
* [Step2](Step2)  
* [Step3](Step3)  
* [Step4](Step4)  
* [Step5](Step5)  
* [Step6](Step6)  
* [Step7](Step7)  

Some of these steps may challenge your skills, if you run into a wall google should be your first outlet. Don't feel like you need everything perfect and finished in these two days. Your site should keep evolving as you continue through this process. Front end design is a process that is inherently never ending.
