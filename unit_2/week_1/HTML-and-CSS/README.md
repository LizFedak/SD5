### HTML Basics

Complete the first three Units of the CodeAcademy 'HTML & CSS' self-study course, and the "Forms" section of either the Quackit or HtmlDog tutorials (or both), linked below. Explore the HTML sections in the additional resources linked below. You do not need to complete all of these sections but you are expected to have a solid understanding of HTML upon completion. A few of the resources also have some CSS content included. Feel free to look this over, however we will be providing you with some separate resources specifically targeting CSS basics.

You should have at least a fundamental understanding of the following HTML elements:

* Basic HTML document structure
* *Structural tags*: h1-h6, p, hr, blockquote, ul, ol, li, properly-nested lists.
* *Links*: a, href.
* *Images*: img, src, alt.
* *Tables*: table, tr, th, td, colspan, rowspan.
* *Forms*: form, input types, radio, checkbox, select/options, submit.

### CSS Basics

Similarly to your HTML studies we want you to begin to learn the basics of CSS. There are some introductory sections in the HTML resources listed above that can be a useful reference for learning CSS. Start by reading the 'Understanding CSS section' of [Building Your First Web Page][BuildingYourFirstWebPage] to start to grasp the basic structure of use of CSS documents. A few of the tutorials may demonstrate changing CSS properties inside of an HTML element's tag (using the `style` attribute). We do not want you to do this, instead get used to writing your properties in an external style sheet that you import with a html `<link>` tag located inside of the `<head></head>` tags. An example of this can be seen below:

`<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="styleSheet.css">`

You should have at least a fundamental understanding of the following CSS techniques:

* Selectors: Targeting individual elements by tag, id, class.
* Basic manipulation of the values of an element's CSS properties.
* Importing and using external style sheets.
* Using a CSS reset to reduce browser inconsistencies.

#### CSS Resources
* [Building Your First Web Page][BuildingYourFirstWebPage]
* [How to insert Styles][w3CSSHowto]
* [Codecademy][Codecademy] (Sections 4-6, don't worry about the projects)
* [CSS Meyer Reset][meyerReset]

### Content Assessment

Your goal for Monday afternoon is to get comfortable with creating a well-structured HTML document and adding elements to it, without needing to Google the basic syntax and tag names. In addition, to HTML begin learning about how you can use CSS to make your raw HTML look nicer. We are going to stress from day 1 that you **DO NOT USE IN-LINE STYLES**, always err on the side of linking an external style sheet. On Tuesday morning, you will have time to complete an assignment that we will assess in class to prove your knowledge of the subject. This assignment will require you to extend your HTML knowledge beyond what is covered in the tutorials.  **DO NOT** put off the self-study until the last minute. We will continue our CSS work on Tuesday as well as touch on a few topics that will help your understanding of the topics to be covered at the end of the week. On Tuesday afternoon you will complete a similar CSS assessment on some basic styling techniques.
