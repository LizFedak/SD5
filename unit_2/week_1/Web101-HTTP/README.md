#### HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol

Three key technologies comprise the Internet application we call the World-Wide Web:

1. HTML - you'll continue to gain proficiency in HTML, along with the related technologies of CSS and JavaScript.  These languages define the front-end, user-facing experience of the Web.

2. Uniform Resource Identifiers - URIs provide a concise, consistent way of uniquely identifying and locating a resource on the Internet.

3. HyperText Transfer Protocol - HTTP provides the language in which web clients and servers communicate and transfer resources.  Creating web applications requires developing expertise in this relatively simple, text-based language, and in the ways it is used.
