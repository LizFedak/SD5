#### Learning Objectives

* Install and run Tomcat server on remote host.
* Deploy application WAR file to remote Tomcat server.
* Use Spring/MVC to develop Java web application using file-based persistence.

#### New Technologies
Now that you've got a handle on coding Java servlets and JavaServer Pages (JSPs), you'll begin using the Spring Web model-view-controller (MVC) framework to put together a Java-based web application.  Your project will accept HTTP requests and manage server-side resources in the form of data saved in files.  In the process, you'll become increasingly familiar with working on the Linux command-line to manage deployed files, view log files, troubleshoot, and resolve problems.
