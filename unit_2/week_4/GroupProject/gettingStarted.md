## Getting Started With Your Group

Receiving a project with a broad range of deliverables can be overwhelming. Where do you start? This can be especially tricky when working in a group. People have different views on how to approach problems as well as expectations of the end product. Your first hurdle is coming up with an idea to build your project around. It is key that you choose something that is not only feasible in the allotted time frame, but also is engaging to all the members of your group. For this project the instructors and TA's will be acting as project managers. They will assist each group, providing technical guidance as well as getting you properly launched on an idea we deem feasible. If approached correctly this will be your first "full stack" application for your portfolio.

It is imperative that you have this working before you move forward with the apps functionality.
