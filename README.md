#### Overview
Welcome!  

We will use this repository to distribute all class materials to you.  On your own machine, you will clone (make an initial copy) this repo so its entire contents are available locally to you.  You will periodically pull (refresh) this repo as we add new material to it.

Don't worry if you've never used or heard of Git or GitHub.  You don't need to be a GitHub expert yet (before long, you will be ... oh yes, you will be!)  We'll walk you through a few simple commands to get started.

##### Your First Pull of This Repo
Open a terminal window.  In the terminal, at the shell command line, do these steps to clone this repo to your desktop:
```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/SkillDistillery/SD5.git
```


#### Even More Exercises!
If you feel like we are ever making it too easy for you, or you just want more practice, ask for them! We can make more, dig out others, or point you towards some resources.

If you want to play with TDD and get some exercises in, I would strongly recommend getting into [exercism.io][exer].
